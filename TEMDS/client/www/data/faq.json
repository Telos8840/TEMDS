        "question": "What is the 'Estimated Delivery Time' that displays when my order is accepted?",
        "answer": "When your order is accepted, the screen will display an Estimated Delivery Time. This is a calculation of when the platform anticipates your delivery to arrive at your drop-off address.\nThe time is based on a number of variables and factors about your order – food preparation time, driver location, your distance from the pickup location, traffic, and other factors. For this reason, the time can change as the delivery progresses. For example, the driver is close to the pickup location and your order is ready quickly, the ETA could go down but if the restaurant or store takes a longer time to prepare your order than anticipated, the ETA could go up. We want you too have the most accurate possible delivery timeframe."
